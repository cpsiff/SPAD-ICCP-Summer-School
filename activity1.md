# Activity 1: Recreate Transient Histograms
Using the TMF8820 and the supplied objects, try to recreate histograms with the following characteristics. The provided images are just examples - just try to match the traits described in the text. An exact match is not necessary. Remember that we're running in pooled mode, with one big pixel, so the sensor field-of-view is somewhat wide (~33 degrees, 60mm full frame equivalent).

## 1. One peak

## 2. Three peaks

## 3. Small peak, Big peak
Hint: the more reflective the object, the higher its corresponding peak will be.

## 4. Three same-height peaks

## 5. Gradual Slope
