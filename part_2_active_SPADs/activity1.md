# Activity 1: Recreate Transient Histograms
Using the TMF8820 and the supplied objects, try to recreate histograms with the following characteristics. The provided images are just examples - just try to match the key features described in the text. An exact match is not necessary. It's recommended that you try to match pooled histograms, rather than one individual zone, as the wider FoV makes it easier. In the pooled histogram, the FoV is ~33 degrees, (60mm full frame equivalent).

Run the visualization script to get started viewing histograms. The script doesn't have a capture function, but you can take a screenshot if you would like to save your histograms.
```bash
python live_vis.py
```

## 1. One peak
Capture a histogram with a single peak.

Example:

![One Peak](media/activity1/1_peak.png)

## 2. Three peaks
Capture a histogram with three distinct peaks.

Example:

![Three peaks](media/activity1/2_three_peaks.png)

## 3. Small peak, Big peak
Capture a histogram with a small peak followed by a large peak. The small peak should appear before the large peak.

Hint: the more reflective the object, the higher its corresponding peak will be.

Example:

![Small Peak Big Peak](media/activity1/3_small_big.png)

## 4. Three same-height peaks
Capture a histogram with three distinct peaks, each of which are a similar height.

Example:

![Three same height peaks](media/activity1/4_three_same_peaks.png)

## 5. Gradual Slope
Capture a histogram with a uniform slope downwards across the entire range.

Example:

![Gradual Slope](media/activity1/5_slope.png)
